# Payson Driver

IOCTL cheat driver base that has cr3 decryption for eac.

This was made for fn (EAC/BE) but can be used as a base for other games. This utilizes MmCopyMemory for reading and memcpy for writing. This is great for a free cheat or learning kernel.

## You need the WDK installed to build and not get errors!
